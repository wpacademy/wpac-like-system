# WPAC Like/Dislike
Simple Like &amp; Dislike Plugin for WordPress. :v:

This plugin was created during basic course of <a href="https://wpacademy.pk/course/wordpress-plugin-development-for-beginners-in-urdu-hindi/" target="_blank">Plugin Development in Urdu</a>. Later we decided to distribute this code so students can use it and even try to improve it for educational purpose.
You can even use it as-is on your WordPress blogs to have a nice & simple like/dislike system.

## Installation

1. Click on the `Download ZIP` button at the right to download the plugin.
2. Upload the entire `wpac-like-system` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress.
