# WPAC Like/Dislike
Simple Like &amp; Dislike Plugin for WordPress. :v:

This plugin was created during basic course of <a href="https://wpacademy.pk/course/wordpress-plugin-development-for-beginners-in-urdu-hindi/" target="_blank">Plugin Development in Urdu</a>. Later we decided to distribute this code so students can use it and even try to improve it for educational purpose.
You can even use it as is on your WordPress blogs to have a nice & simple like/dislike system.
